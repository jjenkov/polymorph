# Polymorph Use Cases and Main Functionality
Below is a list of the personal computing use cases that Polymorph could address.
Exactly which use cases will be addresses and in what sequence - is not yet determined.
The use cases below are just examples, so far.

- Dynamic Interactive Media (DIM)
    - Slides
    - Documents
    - Recipes (cooking, tech runbooks etc.)
    - Books
    - Spreadsheets / Notebooks
    - Charts
    - Diagrams
    - Lists (shopping lists, todo lists etc.)
    - Notes
    - Photos
    - Audiobooks
    - Podcasts
    - Music
    - Video
    - Etc.

- Communication Apps
    - Chat
    - Mail
    - Video conferences
    - File sharing / backup
    - Etc.

Dynamic Interactive Media (DIM) is probably the first area this project will focus on.
First of all, DIM covers a lot of common personal computing use cases. Secondly, many DIM use cases only require
one-way communication – meaning the data (slides, photos etc.) is loaded from a local disk, remote PC, or a server,
and displayed as is. There is no need to send any information back to the source of the data.

Personal Applications will require two-way communication between the user + Polymorph Player  
and the application code itself. This is true whether the application runs inside Polymorph Player, runs
as a separate process connected to Polymorph Player on the same PC, or runs on a remote PC or server.
