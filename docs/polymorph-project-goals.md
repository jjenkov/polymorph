# Polymorph Project Goals

This document outlines the goals of the Polymorph Personal Compute Platform project.
    

## Purpose
Our personal computers keep getting more powerful with multiple different compute devices inside (CPU cores, iGPU, NPU). 
Sadly, many private users do not seem to be taking advantage of them. 

My belief is that this is in part due to the current state of technology for personal computing, where many apps are 
implemented as web apps where most of the computing happens on remote servers. This model does not fully leverage 
the increasing compute power of personal computers.


### Back to the Origin – Into the Future
The purpose of the Polymorph Personal Compute Platform project is to bring personal computing back to a state
where most of the computing happens locally, on the user's devices, on the user's terms. 

Additionally, Polymorph aims at bringing personal computing properly into the Internet age via P2P style communication.
P2P communication is the natural style of communication for personal computing. This enables vastly different types of 
systems than what we have today with The Web. 

### Personal Computing Reimagined
To achieve this, the Polymorph Personal Compute Platform project must reimagine what personal computing is
and how it should be designed. The project must be bold enough to scrutinize and challenge the technological status quo,
while being wise enough to keep what works well.


## Functionality
The purpose may sound a bit abstract, so let's look at what concrete functionality the Polymorph platform
aims at.

### Media Consumption
One of the most common uses of computers is to consume media in various forms, such as audio, video, photos,
presentations, books, articles, recipes, etc.

To meet these use cases, the Polymorph Personal Compute Platform will have a Smart Media Player, which can
display media in various formats. This smart media player can play dynamic, interactive, composable media,
also sometimes referred to as Media Experiences (MEX) – or simply "scripts" – as many such smart media experiences
will be materialized via scripts executed by the smart media player.

### Media Creation
Perhaps there may need to be some media creation tools too, at some point. But in the beginning creators
should be able to use what tools already exist, such as text editors, image editors, video editors, etc. 
Many of them are very advanced, and there is perhaps no reason to replace those tools any time soon.

### Media Composition
Media should be composable. For instance, you should be able to combine a photo and text to display the text
on top of the photo. Or, overlay subtitles or annotations on top of a video. Or, compose a larger video
of smaller video segments. Or, play music in the background of a presentation. Or, add your own notes on top of a presentation.

The composition has to happen outside the media elements being composed. Typically, this composition will happen
in a script.

### Communication
Another big use case for personal computing is communication with friends and family, either via chat or email.

To meet these, the Polymorph platform will eventually have some level of communication tools built in.
However, since there are already several communication tools available, such tools may not be among
the first functionality Polymorph provides.

Most likely, the first communication tools will enable applications to send messages to each other.
What applications we build that take advantage of that, we can figure out as the project evolves. 

### Specialized Applications & Tools
In addition to the core functionality above, the Polymorph platform may eventually get more specialized
applications and tools built in. We will see which, as the project evolves.

### Artificial Intelligence
In the beginning the project will focus mostly on the core functionality. Once the core functionality 
is stable, we may also explore how to integrate AI into the platform. An AI that can run locally, if possible. 
But let's see when we get there.
