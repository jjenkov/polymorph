# Polymorph Personal Compute Platform

The purpose of the Polymorph Personal Compute Platform project is to reimagine what personal computing could look like. 

The project aims at providing a wide variety of common personal computing functionality that is easily accessible
within a single, coherent, flexible platform.

You can read more about the goals of the Polymorph Personal Compute Platform project here:

[Polymorph Project Goals](docs/polymorph-project-goals.md)

Even though the primary target users are personal users – several of the technologies coming out of the Polymorph
project can be used for commercial use cases too – both in small companies and in larger enterprises.

Here is an introduction video to the Polymorph Personal Compute Platform:

## Polymorph Innovation
The full ambitions of the Polymorph Platform project cannot be achieved using any existing technologies.
Web tech cannot get us there. No existing application platforms can get us there. Therefore, the Polymorph project
needs to invent its own technology stack. 

Even though the Polymorph technologies are designed primarily for use within the Polymorph ecosystem,
several of these technologies can be used outside the Polymorph ecosystem as well.
