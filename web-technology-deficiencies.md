# Web Technology Deficiencies

Despite having undergone work since 1989 - 1990, web technologies as they look today (2026) are 
still inherently deficient. 

The Polymorph Personal Compute Platform project attempts to address
some of these deficiencies. That is why the Polymorph project insists on reimagining so much of its tech stack.

The following sections explains the most annoying deficiencies of today's web technology, 
which Polymorph attempts to address.


## Technical Web Tech Deficiencies 
The most central of the web tech deficiencies are the technical deficiencies.
It is the technical deficiencies that

- Streams vs. files and documents.
- UDP vs. TCP.
- P2P vs. client-server.

## Use cases Deficiencies

- Composable media vs. siloed media.
- Built-in end user functionality vs. no built-in end user functionality.

- Local computing vs. remote computing.
- Decentralized computing vs. centralized computing.

## Ownership Deficiencies

- Autonomy vs. dependency
- Collaborative computing vs. consumer / producer consuming


Major deficiency categories (suggested at least)

- Efficiency
- Versatility
- Autonomy
